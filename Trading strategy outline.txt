## When to enter market
I] Check the general trend of the market for a longer period
	i) If trend is upwards: 
		If candle stick pattern indicates growth:
			If RSI is low enough:
				If price is near a support:
					If price is near a moving average and historically above it:
						Set stop loss and targets using the ATR metric
	   	elif candlestick pattern indicates decline:
			If RSI is high enough:
				If price is near resistance
					If price is near moving average and historically below it:
						Give a buy order for when the price comes back up
		else:
			wait for next candle(this is where predicting the next candle is helpful)
	ii) If trend is downwards, lookout for trend reversal
